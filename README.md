# Playwright Python Automation 🚀

## 📖 Overview
This repository documents my journey of upskilling in **Playwright with Python** for modern test automation.  
I am committed to building robust, scalable, and maintainable automation frameworks that align with industry best practices.

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen expertise in Playwright for browser automation.
- Apply Python for test scripting, data-driven testing, and reporting.
- Build recruiter-friendly projects that demonstrate practical automation skills.
- Transition from manual QA/UAT to Automation Engineer and Data Engineering pathways.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Frameworks:** Playwright, Pytest  
- **Tools:** GitHub Actions (CI/CD)  
- **Databases:** SQL (for test data validation)
